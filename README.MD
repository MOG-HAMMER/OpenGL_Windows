OpenGL Study for a 3D modeling/viewer application
==================================================


Here we are gonna try to create a 3D application using the latest OpenGL 4.0-4.4 graphics layer API.

We will make use of Visual Studio 2013 C++ features

Choice of windowing API can be:


FreeGlut

SDL2.0

Windows.h (no requirement of making the software portable, will probably use #define statements for different platform compilers
